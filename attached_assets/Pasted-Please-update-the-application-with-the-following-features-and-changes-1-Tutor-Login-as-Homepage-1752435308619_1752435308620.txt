Please update the application with the following features and changes:

1. ✅ Tutor Login as Homepage:
   - Set the tutor login page (`/login`) as the default homepage (`/`).
   - When the root URL is visited, only the tutor login should be shown.

2. ✅ Hide Admin Login:
   - Remove the admin login link from all pages, navigation menus, and templates.
   - Make the admin login accessible only via a secret route like `/admin-login`.
   - Do not mention or expose this link anywhere in the interface. Please provide me with the exact admin login URL.

3. ✅ Student & Tutor Listing:
   - On the admin dashboard, for both the **students** and **tutors** list:
     - Add a **search bar** to filter by name.
     - Add **filter options**:
       - For tutors: by class group (KG–4, 5–10, Plus One/Two)
       - For students: by class or assigned tutor
     - Add **pagination**:
       - 20 items per page
       - Include next/previous buttons

4. ✅ Detailed Profiles:

5. ✅ Subject-Linked Attendance:
   - When a tutor submits attendance:
     - Only show the subjects assigned to the selected student (as saved during student admission).
     - Dynamically load these subjects in the form based on the student selected.

6. ✅ Invoice Generation (Based on Filters):
   - On both **student** and **tutor profile pages**, include a **“Generate Invoice”** button.
   - This should generate a downloadable PDF invoice based **only on the current filtered results** (month or custom date range).

   - Primary theme color: `#344e80`
   - Accent color: `#43a24c`
   - Use suitable contrasting text colors for readability.

8. ✅ Invoice Errors:
   - Make sure PDF invoice generation works correctly (test outside Replit preview).
   - Ensure paths to logos, fonts, and any static files used in invoices are correct and compatible with production (Render).
   - Add basic error handling if PDF generation fails.

Please ensure everything is tested and ready for deployment to Render. Keep the system mobile-friendly and clean.
