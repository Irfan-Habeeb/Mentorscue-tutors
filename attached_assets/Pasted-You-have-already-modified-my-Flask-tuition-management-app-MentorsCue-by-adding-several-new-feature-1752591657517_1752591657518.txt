You have already modified my Flask tuition management app (MentorsCue) by adding several new features, routes, and UI components. Now I’m getting **Internal Server Errors** when accessing `/admin`, caused by undefined or improperly handled template variables like `students`, `tutors`, `page_num`, etc.

Most recent traceback (example):
jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'tutors' is undefined
— this occurs on `/admin` page load.

Here’s what I need from you now:

---

🔧 **Fix Scope:**

1. ✅ Review **all previous changes you made** (especially new features like:
   - tutor pay-per-class assignments
   - multi-tutor support
   - student/tutor dues UI
   - admin dashboard summaries, leaderboard, earnings filter
   - balance sheets, attendance reports
   - ratings
   - navigation to `/admin/students`, `/admin/tutors`
   )

2. 🧠 Analyze the **entire codebase contextually**, and cross-check each of these:
   - Are all variables passed correctly in `render_template(...)`?
   - Are all templates using only defined and relevant objects?
   - Remove or rewrite any leftover or broken template blocks that reference undefined objects

3. 🛠 Fix all broken Jinja template blocks across:
   - `admin_dashboard.html`
   - `base.html` if needed
   - Any partials used inside the admin pages
   - Related views like `admin_students.html`, `admin_tutors.html` if you created them

4. 📦 Fix or recreate the following if missing:
   - `/admin/students` route and page
   - `/admin/tutors` route and page
   - Ensure pagination only exists where it’s supported
   - Replace broken `students.items`, `tutors.items`, or `iter_pages()` with working logic or remove entirely from `/admin`

5. 🔁 Refactor any sections that were left half-done or broken:
   - Orphan `{% endfor %}`, `{% endif %}`
   - Pagination blocks that no longer receive paginated data
   - Graph preview or filters that rely on missing data

6. 🧪 Make sure `/admin` now works perfectly without any error, and displays:
   - total students, tutors
   - revenue, payout, net balance
   - filters for earnings
   - leaderboard
   - working nav buttons to students and tutors sections

7. ⚠️ Most importantly: **don’t leave any broken references** in HTML or Jinja blocks. If something is no longer passed from `routes.py`, remove it or safely default it.

---

📌 Output Instructions:

- Tell me which files you modified (with clear file names)
- For each fix, explain what was wrong and what was changed
- Provide a final confirmation that `/admin` and other admin pages render without error

This is a **fully deployed Flask app**, so do not leave anything half-done or relying on placeholder code that breaks Jinja rendering.

Work thoroughly. Don't skip validation. ✅
