Create a full-stack Flask web app called "MentorsCue" — a tuition management system. This app must have two roles: Admin and Tutors.

✔️ Admin Dashboard (login not required):
- Add/Edit/Delete students (name, class, per-class fee: ₹160/180/200, assigned tutor, subjects)
- Add/Edit/Delete tutors (name, class group, per-class pay: ₹100/120/140, username, password)
- Passwords should be securely hashed
- View all attendance records
- Delete individual or all attendance records for any tutor
- Generate downloadable PDF invoices:
    - For parents: show subject-wise class count, total fee
    - For tutors: show all classes taken, for whom, subjects, and total salary

✔️ Tutor Login:
- Each tutor logs in securely with username + password
- After login, tutor is taken to `/submit`
- Form shows:
    - Student (dropdown of only their assigned students)
    - Subject (dropdown or input)
    - Auto-filled date (today)
    - Optional remarks
- Submitting form stores attendance data under their tutor ID

✔️ Design and Styling:
- Headings font: Cormorant Garamond
- Body font: Figtree
- Background: #cedce7
- Primary color: #344e80
- Accent color: #43a24c
- Text color: match contrast (#2e3a4d preferred)
- Clean layout with modern UI: cards, spacing, rounded corners
- Responsive on mobile

✔️ PDF Invoices:
- Generate parent invoices with subject-wise breakdown and total due
- Generate tutor invoices with class count, student names, subjects, and salary
- Include uploaded MentorsCue logo
- Footer: "Powered by MentorsCue — Online Tuition & Mentorship"

✔️ Tech stack:
- Flask + SQLite + Jinja2
- HTML/CSS + Bootstrap or Tailwind
- `werkzeug.security` for password hashing
- Local PDF generation with `reportlab` or `WeasyPrint`

✔️ Notes:
- Store everything in one Replit project
- Structure folders for templates, static, and database
- All logic must run on free Replit (no external paid APIs)
- Let me know where to upload the logo
- Admin should be able to create tutor login credentials from the dashboard
